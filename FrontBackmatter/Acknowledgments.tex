\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
During these years, I had the opportunity and privilege to meet a large set of people who made my experience of the PhD a rich and rewarding part of my life.\\
I especially want to thank John Marioni for making me the first employee of his young group leader career and trusting me throughout the terms of this PhD. Working at EBI with him during tese years has been a privilege and I'm pretty sure I will be able to say ``this guy was my boss when I was a PhD student'' proudly in the years to come when looking at high impact papers in transcriptomics.\\
I also want to thank the rest of the group Marioni group who has grown over the years, my fellow PhD students Konrad and Robert, the hard(ly?) working post-docs Kim, Anestis, Nuno, Luis, Antonio and
