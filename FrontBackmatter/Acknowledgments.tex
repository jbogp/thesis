\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
During the last four years, I had the opportunity and privilege to meet a large set of people who made this experience a rich and rewarding part of my life.\\

I especially want to thank John Marioni for making me the first employee of his young group leader career and for trusting me throughout this PhD. Working at EBI with him during these years has been a privilege and I am sure I will be able to say ``this guy was my boss when I was a PhD student'' proudly in the years to come when looking at high impact papers in transcriptomics.\\

I would like to thank my collaborators in EMBL Heidelberg, especially Kaia Achim with whom it has been a pleasure working. I also would like to thank Lamiae Azizi from BSU who has been a great help developing the statistical methods.\\

I also want to thank the rest of the Marioni group who has grown over the years, my fellow PhD students Konrad and Robert, the hard(ly?) working post-docs Jong Kyoung Kim, Anestis Touloumis, Nuno Fonseca, Luis Saraiva, Antonio Scialdone and Catalina Vallejos as well as the people close to the group namely Angela Goncalves and Ana Alastruey.\\

Finally I would like to thank my parents who have supported me throughout all this and the people close to me during this roller coaster ride that is a PhD: Camille Jahel, Samuel Croset, Felix Kruger, Benedetta Baldi, Christine Seeliger, Angela Goncalves, Nenad Bartonicek, Isabelle Serma, Benjamin Stauch, Konrad Rudolph, Niels Konlling and my old friends Benoit Othoniel, Maxime Pousse, Yannis Lemonnier and Arnaud Bensadoun.
