\section*{Thesis summary: Spatial analysis of complex biological tissues from single cell gene expression data}
The understanding of life in terms of biological function is a highly complex and crucially important subject in terms of basic and applied research through medicine and healthcare. The way scientists look at biological tissues has greatly evolved throughout time and has rather recently  been revolutionized again by the technological advances leading to the human genome. With this developements, the \emph{-omics} fields were created.
