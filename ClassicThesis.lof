By contrast, in the simulated data the expression of such a gene will lose its spatial coherency, leading to an increased area of expression discontinuity. The number of cells having a neighbour with some differences in the gene expression pattern is directly linked to the value of $\beta _h$ through the energy function described in Chapter \ref {ch:HMRF}.
